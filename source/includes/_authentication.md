# Authentication
In order to use the Staphopia API, you must first register an account with [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu/accounts/register/). Once you have registered an account you will receive an API Token. The API token provides read-only access to the API. You can not make any changes to your account or the database with the token.

### Acquiring Your API Token
First you will want to navigate to [Staphopia](https://staphopia.emory.edu). Once you get there go ahead and login.
