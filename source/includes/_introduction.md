# Introduction
Staphopia is a web platform for the bioinformatic analysis of publicly available *Staphylococcus aureus* genomes. We process each genome through the same analysis pipeline, allowing comparable results between samples. These results are then stored in a centralized database. 

Analyses Include:

+ Sequence quality control
+ Assembly
+ Sequence typing
+ SCCmec typing
+ Gene prediction and annotation
+ 31-mer counting
+ Variant calling

The Staphopia API provides a simple way access the results these results.
